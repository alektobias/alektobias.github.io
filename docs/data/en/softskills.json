  "I view software development as a never-ending process of self-improvement. From small startups to massive global companies, I've seen how different teams operate, and that has taught me how to adapt and add value anywhere. I'm genuinely passionate about doing things right, looking for solutions that are robust and sustainable, rather than just quick fixes.",
  "Working remotely has shaped how I collaborate. Moving to Canada and integrating into multicultural teams taught me that clear, empathetic communication is the glue that holds everything together. Refining my English in this environment pushed me to always prioritize clarity, connecting the dots between technical challenges and the bigger picture so every teammate feels supported and aligned.",
  "I don't just write lines of code; I think about the product. I believe a developer must be engaged, curious, and truly interested in the 'why' behind the features. My posture is one of active ownership: I look beyond the ticket to understand the user's needs and the business goals, ensuring we're building the right thing, not just implementing a spec.",
  "Having previously served as a Tech Lead, I understand the weight of that role and the distinct position of every player on the team. I know that success isn't solo; it's systemic. This experience allows me to mentor effectively, communicate across disciplines, and act as a stabilizing force, ensuring that everyone has what they need to do their best work."
